# [Termeh - Fashion Content Creator - Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM)

## Introduction and Purpose
Keyvan: [0:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=1s) Hi Termeh, thank you so much for taking the time today. How are you doing?

Termeh: [0:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=7s) Hi, I'm good. How are you?

Keyvan: [0:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=13s) All good, all good. So today we have this interview about, uh, the for discovery of a product, and we wanted to, uh, take pick your brain about this subject because I know you have some really cool experience in the domain and, uh, wanted to go through some questions with you.

## Termeh's Background: Architecture, Fashion, and Content Creation
Keyvan: [0:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=13s) First, can you tell us, um, about yourself? Like your age, your background, what do you do for a living, what do you do artistic wise? A a primer on your background.

Termeh: [0:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=44s) Okay, great. I'm, uh, 29, not 30 yet. Uh, my name is Termeh, as you said. Uh, I studied architecture back home, but, uh, I always love fashion, so when I came to Canada, I kind of started to work in like fashion field. And then after like maybe like one year, because I've been here like for three years, I started to do content creating. I do have like a full-time job, obviously, because you have to make a living here. So I am a system manager at Coach now. But, uh, I do, I do like part-time I work on YouTube as well. So I just started to like, um, work on YouTube, and I think maybe in like long term, I can make it like, I don't know, like a business. I can, uh, offer like a product. So that's like the long term plan for YouTube.

## Journey into YouTube and Content Focus
Keyvan: [1:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=1m45s) Yeah, that's actually the the part that we are most interested on because I I' I've been following your your, uh, content as well. Uh, and and can you dig into how that started? Your journey into YouTube, like early days, assembling an audience. Give us like a background of what what initiated it, like what why why you decided in the first place to start posting videos on YouTube, and then how you go about it? Like do you, um, first, let's let's start there. Like what what initiated the YouTube?

Termeh: [2:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=2m24s) So I always wanted to have like a platform to talk about fashion, and I wanted it to be like professional because I know we don't have like so many like, uh, Persian sources for fashion. I started on like Instagram, but honestly, it's not a platform that you can take your time and like talk about it like professionally. So and that's why I actually thought about YouTube because you have like longer videos. So I did start vlogging first, and then I realized I need to work on something that I'm actually like passionate about. So I kind of changed the subject to like fashion, and I'm enjoying it like a lot more. So that's how I started to like work on YouTube.

Keyvan: [3:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=3m5s) That's amazing to hear. So you you started with vlogging? Vlogging meaning like just lifestyle, um, recording lifestyle?

Termeh: [3:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=3m16s) Okay, lifestyle and also fashion. I did have like at the beginning, uh, I was like talking about like how to create a style, and then, uh, it was like lifestyle vlogging. But now it's just about fashion, so I don't have like the lifestyle part anymore.

## Pivot to Fashion Content: Internal and External Influences
Keyvan: [3:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=3m34s) That pivot between these two verticals, uh, was it internal purely, like your preference? You saw that, oh, this is not my type of content, or was it also the perception, the people on the other end seeing the content? Did they have any input in change of direction?

Termeh: [3:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=3m53s) So it was both. Uh, I always wanted to, uh, like work and talk about fashion, and also all of my friends and whoever watched my content, they were like, whenever you talk about fashion, because like this is your profession and you know it, like you know about it like more and they enjoyed it like better. So they actually offered me to create the content specifically in like fashion field, and they were right too. I'm enjoying it like a lot more.

## YouTube Video Creation Process: From Idea to Upload
Keyvan: [4:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=4m21s) Nice, great to hear. Um, all right, so let's now get into the process a little. Um, can you walk us through like a video's life cycle? How do you arrive from an an idea to a video posted on YouTube? Can you walk us through steps that you take with when when you just like want to upload something to like a video uploaded?

Termeh: [4:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=4m48s) So I try to upload like video once a week. So once I'm done with a video, I first think about like the subject of my of my like next video, obviously. And then at first that I started to like, um, taking the videos, I was not like, uh, writing a script, and then I realized I need to have like a script because it actually fasten the process too, once you know what you're going to talk about. So now, uh, I first pick the subject, then I try to do the script, and then, uh, once I have the script, I try to take the video, and then obviously it's the editing process, and then I'm just going to post the video.

## Scriptwriting and Tool Usage (ChatGPT)
Keyvan: [5:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=5m34s) Nice. And and so in the process of arriving at that script, um, how do you plan it? Do you, uh, do you do? I don't know, like how do you gather the ideas, what tools do you use to, uh, like pen it down? Can you tell us about specifically as well tools and so there's stuff that happens inside Termeh's mind and stuff that happens around Termeh. Can you tell us how that interaction works?

Termeh: [6:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=6m6s) Mhm. So, uh, when I think about a script, I usually try to write it down and then I sometimes, uh, ask for help, like ask for my husband's help, to see like if I can add something maybe to it. And then if I see it's not like a complete and a good script, I also like sometimes use ChatGPT because that also helps for like writing the scripts.

Keyvan: [6:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=6m31s) Nice. Okay. Um, again, if you don't mind, can you dig a bit into the ChatGPT use case? What are your interactions with ChatGPT? Like in that, do do you ask it, uh, like, um, like high level questions? Like what should the video be about? Or do you give it pointers? Oh, this is the video that give me a net script. Is it is it the collaboration, or is it like, uh, Termeh is the CEO, ChatGPT is the worker?

Termeh: [7:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=7m1s) Yo, it's definitely the worker. I don't trust AI at all. I don't like using like ChatGPT like a lot, I don't trust that. So, uh, I do have my subject, and I also have my script. So I'm just going to give my script to ChatGPT and I just ask ask it to like organize it for me for like a YouTube video. So even like what I'm going to talk about, I already like give it to ChatGPT and the only thing it does for me is like organizing it. So that's it. But like, uh, taking ideas, I've never done it, but I know so many people do that. And, um, I mean like, it it works for them. I've never tried it, maybe I should, but I've never tried it.

## Enjoyable vs. Tedious Parts of Content Creation
Keyvan: [7:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=7m46s) Okay, so it's the refining that ChatGPT does more than anything else. Very cool. Um, right, so back to that that that, um, process of uploading a video. Would you what would you say is the hardest part, more most tedious part that's not enjoyable, uh, in the in the in the from when you start to when it's uploaded on YouTube? What part you don't enjoy?

Termeh: [8:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=8m18s) This is technically my hobby, so I do enjoy like the whole process, to be honest with you. So when I was, uh, vlogging, uh, taking the videos in public, that was like the most hard or like thing that I didn't like to do. But now, only because the location of all of my videos is I do it like at home, or somewhere like private, without like people around me. So there is nothing that I actually don't enjoy about. But I would say like the hardest part, uh, the hardest part is take like taking the video for me because you have to be like prepared for me. Uh, I need to create a style, I need to do my makeup. So I can't do it like at any time, even if I'm not in the mood or this and that because I also need to like talk. So I would say that's like the hardest part, but I enjoy the whole process. It's my hobby.

Keyvan: [9:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=9m11s) Absolutely. Um, yeah, no, well, I mean, more to the effective, like this is this is, um, um, the part that's not essentially the part that I want to do repeatedly. I would rather have this part automated is my point. Like if if this part is just it's just repetitive work and it's not creative, it's not artistic, but I I would rather have this part automated. Do you identify parts like that specifically?

Termeh: [9:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=9m50s) I would say that part would be the editing. If if somebody could do it for me, or if it was like automatic, uh, that would be great, yeah.

## Video Editing Process and Challenges
Keyvan: [9:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=9m57s) That's so true. Yeah, editing is. And and you already would you say you already know what the edit is, is just the putting it in is a lot of work, right? Or do you is it like a discovery process? As you edit, you figure out what you want at the end result?

Termeh: [10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=10m25s) Uh, I would say once I have my videos and I just put it all together, then I decide how to do like the editing. And I'm not like a professional at it, it's just I just learned it when I started to work on YouTube. But I think it's like very time consuming since like the videos are also like very long. So I don't know, on Instagram, Tik Tok, you only have like less than a minute videos, so it's going to be like easy to like edit, uh, usually. But for YouTube, because it's like a very long video and you need to like keep it like interesting along the video. So that's the editing. I think it's the content, and it's also how you edit the video. I think that's like the hardest part and I'm still like working on it because I'm not a professional at it.

## Visual Elements and Inspirations in Edits
Keyvan: [11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=11m14s) Nice. Um, and in your edits, do you, I remember you did this in in your Instagram, like adding visual clues, like stickers or making the story in more interesting? Do you do that kind of stuff on your YouTube videos as well, or is it just like the content?

Termeh: [11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=11m32s) That's a good idea actually, I've never done it on YouTube. But, uh, when I do it on Instagram, it's just, uh, it's the idea, it's the inspiration of my style because every outfit that I create, I usually have like a inspiration for it. So, uh, that's what I add to my like Instagram content. But for my YouTube videos, just because it's like more, it has like a subject, professional subject in fashion that I talk about, it's not some something that I'm like inspired by. I've never used it, but honestly I've thought about it. I've never done it and maybe it's coming soon. That's a good idea, you gave me You gave me an idea, yeah.

## Post-Upload: Monitoring Metrics and Improving Content
Keyvan: [12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=12m16s) I'm happy to. All right, I I I'll try to give you more ideas down the road. But that's, uh, all right. So, um, do you, um, let's talk about the other side of it. Um, when it's shipped, a video is uploaded and it's live. Do you after the fact that the video is live have any tools or any metrics there? Like do what do you monitor? What's what's your expected outcome? What do you measure and how do you improve for the next time? Do you have a process for it?

Termeh: [12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=12m58s) Uh, so for YouTube, obviously, when you first start, uh, you need to be monetized. So the most important thing is the watch time of your video. So the first thing I look at is like, uh, the watch time of my video. And I know like if you have like a script that people don't want to follow, they don't keep watching the video. So, uh, that's something I need to change. So I learned a lot about what kind of subject I should choose for like YouTube videos because it actually make like a huge difference. So once it's something that people, I don't know, like if it's like unboxing that people want to keep like following to see what's coming next, the watch time is like very good. So you kind of have to create like a content that people keep watching it. So I would say it's impression, uh, like how many accounts YouTube actually, uh, suggests the video and then is the watch time. I think that's the most important thing for YouTube first that you start. Like views, I don't think it matters that much.

## AI and Software Tool Usage
Keyvan: [14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=14m5s) Got it, nice, perfect. Um, so you mentioned ChatGPT. Do you use any other AI tools, uh, apart from chat, or is chat your only AI friend?

Termeh: [14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=14m18s) I'm not a tech person, that's all I know. Nice.

Keyvan: [14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=14m20s) That's all I know, yeah. But, uh, on the software front, on the, uh, video editing and other other types of software that you use, first, are these all on your laptop, or any of them are...? Well, chat's on your mobile, right, when you use it even for...?

Termeh: [14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=14m36s) On both.

Keyvan: [14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=14m38s) Oh, you use it on both, okay. Um, on my laptop or my on my phone? Got it. Uh, how about other software? Uh, do you you mentioned editing. What editing software you use?

Termeh: [14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=14m51s) I use, uh, iMovie. Okay.

Keyvan: [14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=14m53s) For editing, yeah.

Termeh: [14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=14m54s) And that's but and I do it on my laptop. I don't do it on my phone, yeah.

Keyvan: [15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=15m0s) Anything else? Any other type of software that's in involved in the process? I don't know, like a fashion specific software? Like, or websites? Like this is where I source my material or where I check frequently.

Termeh: [15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=15m18s) Uh, so yes, when I want to like, um, talk about like a subject, I actually have to, uh, collect like infos. It's usually like it's WWE, it's Vogue, it's L, like all the magazines that actually like professionally talk about fashion. I do use the app to create outfits, it's called Index, I also use that. So yeah, I do use like so many like website and tools that it's like specifically related to fashion for my videos.

## Aspirations for Virality and Content Success
Keyvan: [15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=15m48s) Nice. Okay, last question and this, uh, is just for data. Feel free to like say, um, yeah, like this is not to like give you a direction, it's just to get your honest opinion on it. Do you care about going viral ever in a video?

Termeh: [16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=16m10s) Of course I do.
All right, I mean that's my, I mean, that's, I mean like this is not my job, or it's not something that I rely on. But eventually, if I can quit my job and full-time work on creating content, that will be great. Of course, that's that's that's my mission. All right.

Keyvan: [16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=16m29s) And do you, um, have you had like a a specific video or content that has gone viral to a bit to a degree, has viewed been viewed most than anything else that you posted? And if so, what has been the cause, what has been the push that distinctively pushed that video to be viewed more than everything else that you've published?

Termeh: [16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=16m56s) I mean, uh, viral, I don't think none of my videos actually went viral. But one of my YouTube videos got like a very good watch time, and I think it was the unboxing that I mentioned. Because I ordered like so many things, and it was something that people wanted to like keep watching. So like the watch time was like very high. So it's like a huge gap between like any other of my videos. So that it, I learned a lot about that video. After that, I try to like, you know, create my content like very similar to that, and it actually works.

## Collaborations and Valuing Expert Connections
Keyvan: [17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=17m31s) Yeah, nice. Um, any collaborations, like artistic collaboration? I've seen it that I don't want to spoil it, but but you you, uh, bring other people, collaborate with other people. Can you speak to it? Like, um, if if they have positive effect and why do you do it, and like how does it go in collaborations?

Termeh: [17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=17m53s) Uh, I do do it, uh, with my friends, uh, and whoever is actually like, uh, interested in fashion, obviously. And I think, uh, sometimes it actually works if two content creators, it's like two brains, two different ideas, and it it just makes it like better and like more interesting. Because sometimes you want to make a difference in your video, so it actually excites your audience. It it just makes a difference that like you know, it creates like a hype maybe within your content. So I do do that, I do it with my friends. I'm doing it today. I'm taking like a video with one of my friends. She's also like a content creator. So yeah, if I have a friend that actually can ask, uh, their help, obviously, I will do that.

Keyvan: [18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=18m45s) All right. And last follow-up question on that topic. Um, I give you two options. Um, 10,000 followers in one hand, and 20 content creators collaborating with you in the other hand, like actively on the specific video that you're going to make. 20 collaborators. That's that's the, uh, red pill. The blue pill is, uh, just 10,000 followers, generic. Which one do you take?

Termeh: [19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=19m21s) I pick, um, 10K followers for sure. Because once you have like the numbers, everybody's going to collaborate with you.

Keyvan: [19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=19m25s) Got it, that's all that matters. So you get both technically.

Termeh: [19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=19m33s) I want both.

Keyvan: [19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=19m33s) So this is my. That's nice. That's right. But do you do you actually care about that subject of having people interested in the exact topic? Not not necessarily even content creators, not not essentially competitors, but just people to brainstorm with, not just consumers? Like, uh, opinion leaders, experts, say, it's like a fashion designer that's working on the exact topic of the video that you're creating. Would would that kind of connections would be be valuable to you on demand?

Termeh: [20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=20m10s) Absolutely, that's something that I actually makes me excited to like actually keep working on these videos because like I, I might not get that many views, but maybe on like Instagram or like YouTube, I've had like messages from like professional people like admiring what I talked about, or the style, or the outfit I created. That actually makes me even more happy to get like tons of views of people who don't even understand the work. So of course, yeah, that's that's very important to me.

## Introduction to "vhybZ" Solution and Initial Feedback
Keyvan: [20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=20m42s) Nice. All right. Okay, so this section of the interview is done. This was just like essentially getting all the ideas out of you without giving you any bias. Now I want to talk a bit about the solution, about what I'm building and gauge your interest in it, see if you would be open to using something like this. So, um, just a little, um, background on what it is. I want to build a mobile app that complements things that you do with ChatGPT. So you mentioned that you use ChatGPT for something like script refinement, right? Mhm. Uh, and ChatGPT only gives you text. Any any any answer question format is just text, right? So this new app gives you artifacts, gives you images, posters, whatever you prompt instead of getting, um, like a text, an answer, you generate, um, a an art. And this can be in any format, can be video, can be image, can so it's an artifact. As you you remember from your architecture days, it can you can it can be like a a 3D map for that matter, right? So there are on the background like software that you install on Windows, there are engines that render different types of assets. Uh, but...

Termeh: [22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=22m8s) Oh, that's so cool.

Keyvan: [22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=22m10s) That's that's the solution. And and the goal of opening this app is not back and forth conversation. It's starting an asset and then following prompts improves it. So you say, "Oh, generate like a a a lady wearing a jean, right?" And then then you follow up, no, make the jean look cooler in this way and that way, right? So the the thing in the middle with following prompt improves and improves and becomes something else. So...

Termeh: [22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=22m43s) Oh my god, that's great. That's great actually. In terms of like artistic subjects, I think, I think artists going to love to use something like that.

Keyvan: [22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=22m50s) Yeah. And and and you talked about, um, um, adding visual elements to your video. This could be a venue for that because then you can custom prompt it as opposed to like generic, I don't know, heart emoji in this in the middle.

Termeh: [23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=23m9s) That's what I was thinking, yeah.

## "vhybZ" Go-To-Market: Interactive Experiences and Virality
Keyvan: [23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=23m10s) Right. So so that's a solution and also I want to pick your, uh, brain on on the go to market for it, right? So this obviously can be a a a useful tool like when you want to create something and place it in your own work. But I also need like a viral element myself for this app, right? So what I came up with and and our team are working on, uh, is, uh, this element that you can share what you create as a link, right? So you can create, uh, something. So the the name is vhybZ. So our website is vhybZ.com. So you can create termeh.vhybZ.com, right? And then you can say slash jeans experiment, right? So termeh.vhybZ.com is your like general portfolio. Then jeans experiment is something that you've created as a creator, um, that's an interactive experience. So it's a new type of content, just like you have Instagram stories or you have YouTube, you can have these vhybZ experiences that when users take them, it, they, it opens in the browser, but they can participate in it. So you you have something there, maybe you're wearing stuff, but then they push on the microphone microphone and start talking Termeh, do this. Maybe it's a virtual Termeh. Termeh will start doing what the user says, right? And at the end of that interaction, a 15-second video is generated for the user from that interaction. Can be voice, can be their face. So maybe it, as you said, editing is very hard, they don't need to do any editing. The AI will see what was interesting in this half an hour of interaction and give them that 15-second video, and then they can reshare. So, honest answer, don't need to spare my feelings, is this interesting to you as a medium to use for your audience and and use for yourself?

Termeh: [25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=25m15s) I would definitely use something like that. Like, honestly, I think it's very cool. I think it's very interesting and I think it's something, it's like a hobby. I mean, like, you can go on it and just, um, I don't know, spend your time like two, three hours and don't even realize the time because to me, that's like a very, it actually excites me. It's very cool. But I don't know, uh, what I'm thinking is just, uh, I don't know how to make people, um, pay for like subscription or something like that. So I think everybody would love to use something like this. But maybe you can just create like a premier aspect of it, so people can actually be charged for that. But using it for free, 100%. But how to make me to pay for it, that's something I think you should be it should be worked on, yeah.

Keyvan: [26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=26m11s) Absolutely. But if it's free, let's remove the showstopper from it. If it's free, it would be something that you would say you would use daily?

Termeh: [26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=26m26s) I would say so, yeah. It's so cool because as I told you, I have like inspiration, I can talk about that. I can develop this like inspiration. So now I want to use it. If you have it, just give it to me.

Keyvan: [26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=26m40s) Yeah, then absolutely. Yeah, my toddler is also throwing a tantrum on the outside. Mr. Atyan, can you slow down, please? Okay, all right, all right. Um, that was, uh, I think...

## Audience Participation and Concerns
Keyvan: [27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=27m0s) Uh, so did did did a bit on the, um, user side when I said like your your audience will be able to participate. Does that excite you, or does it is it does it sound weird to you that you can create content that then from your content your audience can create more content? Is this interesting to you or weird?

Termeh: [27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=27m24s) I think it's a very good idea. It develops the idea, yeah.

Keyvan: [27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=27m27s) Mhm. All right. Um, what's your biggest concern, would you say, from hearing this? Like like just just analyzing it for this short minutes. Do you see this, oh, I have this privacy concern, I have this, uh, whatever? Does it does anything occur to you immediately?

Termeh: [27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=27m49s) Uh, I would say concerns. If if you actually have like an very good idea that you don't want to share it to like everybody, so I think people would, uh, share ideas that it's, I mean like, it's not as important as like the other ones. Maybe it's just more like a fun part to it. But I think when it comes to having like an idea that you think it it matters and you've worked on for like a long time, because some artists actually do that, so I don't think they would be, uh, comfortable enough to share those kind of ideas.

## Monetization Potential for Creators
Keyvan: [28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=28m23s) What about if they can monetize it? So if you create this asset and it becomes this app, a library, and whoever uses your asset, you'll be paid for it. So say someone comes in and remixes Termeh's creation, and if that content generates revenue, Termeh will share some revenue. Would that be interesting?

Termeh: [28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=28m51s) Yeah, that's something I think it makes it like so much easier to share the idea because you you're kind of getting paid for it. So that's great. That's, yeah, that's a solution, I think.

Keyvan: [28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=28m58s) Okay, all right, all right.

## Final Pointers and Feature Prioritization
Keyvan: [29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=29m4s) Um, okay. Um, any? Let me let me check. Go to quickly through my checklist. Uh, no, that's that's all I had in in my checklist. Anything you want to add, you want to ask me, and do you do you see you? You see, oh, Keyvan, pay attention to this, this is important, you're not seeing this, I'm I've done this, been there, consider this. Do you have these types of pointers for me or questions? Let's, we're about to wrap it up.

Termeh: [29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=29m35s) Uh, I would say do not offer everything on the table at the same time. I think because there there are like a lot to offer. I think your idea is just like so many things that you're offering. Maybe you can do it like one at a time. And if it actually...

Keyvan: [29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=29m50s) What is the one thing that resonates with you more between all the things that you like? If if, as you said, if we do want to do it one at a time, what's the first thing to do for Termeh?

Termeh: [30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=30m2s) Uh, I would say the first thing is the first idea that you shared. So it's visualize, uh, like in a script that you give it like to the app or, uh, I think that should be like the first thing. And then we talked about like more things. I I think do not offer everything at the same time because this is something I think so many people would want to use. Mhm. So maybe if it actually goes viral, then you can, uh, work on, I don't know, like subscription, you can charge people. So do not offer everything at the same time, I think.

## Core Hook: Going Viral vs. Creating Visuals
Keyvan: [30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=30m33s) Good. And would you say between these two two categories, uh, vhybZ is a tool, is a toolbox for going viral? That's category one. vhybZ is the toolbox for creating visual elements. Between these two, which of them is more interesting as the hook for download for Termeh? Which one would would entice you to download this app and use it? Going viral or creating visuals?

Termeh: [31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=31m7s) I think it's creating visuals for me.

Keyvan: [31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=31m10s) That's a really cool data point. All right, that's amazing. Any other pointers, questions?

Termeh: [31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=31m17s) I think that's everything.

## Closing
Keyvan: [31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=31m18s) Okay, let's pose for a picture. This will be our thumbnail. I do also, I hate editing, I do minimal. I I won't essentially won't edit this video. I will just upload it. So let's do something, and this will be our thumbnail. Yay.

Keyvan: [31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=31m35s) Okay, thank you so much for your time, Termeh. It was great talking to you.

Termeh: [31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E96bKjBbYgM&t=31m43s) Thank you, it was very nice talking to you. That was a great idea. Good luck. Cheers. Have a great rest of the day.
