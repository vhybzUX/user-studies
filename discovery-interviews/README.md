# Discovery Interviews

## Overview

This document summarizes findings from a series of five user interviews conducted as part of the discovery phase for "Project vhybZ." The primary goal of these interviews was to gain a deep understanding of how different individuals approach content creation, what their current workflows look like, the tools they utilize (with a particular focus on AI), and the various pain points, needs, and aspirations they have in this domain.

The interviews were conducted one-on-one via video calls, recorded, and then transcribed. Participants ranged from a musician/software engineer, a computer science student active in hackathons, a high school student, a fashion content creator, to a GenAI business owner. This diverse group provided a broad perspective on creative and technical challenges. The interviewer (Keyvan) guided these conversations, typically introducing the "vhybZ" product concept towards the end of each session to gather initial reactions and gauge interest in an AI-powered platform for creating interactive and shareable digital artifacts.

The insights gathered are intended to directly inform the product vision, feature prioritization, and go-to-market strategy for Project vhybZ.

## Problems Identified

The following is a breakdown of issues, needs, and wants articulated by the interviewees. References point to the specific interview file and line number where the point was discussed.

### Pains
*(Issues that are "hair on fire" problems, causing significant frustration, emotional distress, or impatience.)*

*   **Video editing is overwhelmingly tedious, time-consuming, and often perceived as uncreative grunt work.** ([01-Mani.md:60-65](01-Mani.md#L60), [04-Termeh.md:91-93](04-Termeh.md#L91), [04-Termeh.md:99-103](04-Termeh.md#L99))
*   **Traditional video production (e.g., via agencies) is too slow and expensive, especially for marketers needing agility.** ([05-Sid.md:43-45](05-Sid.md#L43))
*   **Poor or unclear documentation for technical projects (like GitHub repositories) leads to significant frustration and wasted time trying to make things work.** ([02-Julien.md:160-163](02-Julien.md#L160))
*   **Investing significant effort into content that subsequently underperforms is a source of frustration and feels tedious.** ([01-Mani.md:109-111](01-Mani.md#L109))
*   **Hitting creative roadblocks where initial ideas prove unexecutable is a common and tedious experience.** ([01-Mani.md:85-87](01-Mani.md#L85))
*   **Current AI (like free ChatGPT or less advanced models) can be frustratingly "dumb," losing context in longer conversations or requiring excessive prompting to get desired results.** ([01-Mani.md:219-221](01-Mani.md#L219), [03-Hastia.md:197-200](03-Hastia.md#L197))
*   **The fear of negative public reaction (hate comments) or the perceived suffocating nature of online fame can be a significant deterrent to posting content.** ([03-Hastia.md:50-54](03-Hastia.md#L50))
*   **AI for highly nuanced creative tasks (e.g., music mix/mastering) is often not yet good enough, with human touch still being superior.** ([01-Mani.md:167-171](01-Mani.md#L167))
*   **The difficulty of accurately integrating specific products or elements into videos using general AI models like Sora is a major challenge for marketers.** ([05-Sid.md:156-159](05-Sid.md#L156))
*   **Recording demo videos for technical projects can take multiple attempts to achieve clarity, especially under pressure or with little sleep.** ([02-Julien.md:165-167](02-Julien.md#L165))

### Needs
*(Essential functions, tools, or workflows that users rely on, are "addicted" to, or see as great utilities for their processes.)*
