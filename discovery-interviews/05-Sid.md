# [Sid - GenAI Biz Owner / Vinci Studio - Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE)

## Introduction and Context
Keyvan: [0:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=2s) Hi Sid, how are you doing?

Sid: [0:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=4s) Hello, all well, all well. How are you?

Keyvan: [0:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=8s) Nice nice, thank you so much. I'm all good. I'm just, uh, as you know, so Sid and I are in part of the same accelerator program, so many of the beans have been already spoiled for it of what this interview is about. I don't need to give him an overview, he's doing it himself.

## Sid's Background and Vinci Studio Overview
Keyvan: [0:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=25s) Um, to start, can you give us, uh, an overview of your background? How old are you? What what's your background? And like what you've done professionally, what you're currently doing?

Sid: [0:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=40s) Awesome, sure. So, uh, I'm 28. I actually turned 28 yesterday.

Keyvan: [0:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=47s) Happy birthday!

Sid: [0:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=47s) Thank you. And, uh, I'm an MBA grad. I, uh, my formal education is all along being in, uh, business study. Uh, my undergrad was a rather broader, uh, business studies, the, you know, major. So it it it covers, you know, some amount of, uh, STEM courses, uh, plus, uh, what they what they defined as management sciences, right? So economics, statistics, uh, and, uh, yeah. And then followed by an MBA. Uh, I think during college is when I formed a lot of my, uh, you know, deep-seated interest in consumer tech and, uh, therefore also venture into, you try to try to work with companies, take internships in the same space. Further strengthened my interest, uh, you know, in in blockchain with with a bunch of side projects. And I think that's where most things, uh, culminated into an interest in the broader, uh, consumer tech space and, uh, also also to pursue entrepreneurship, right? So, uh, yeah, I think, uh, after after my MBA, I ended up working for about four years in, uh, first at a consumer electronics company for about just over a year, uh, in an entrepreneur in residence role. Uh, and then followed by working with the adtech team of a large consumer, uh, e-commerce company, uh, based in India. After which I started Vinci. Vinci, uh, is a play in the AI video space. Uh, the idea that we're right now working on is to make AI videos easier for marketers specifically. Uh, what we have identified is that there are, uh, a lot of use cases, uh, that today which are being traditionally pursued by marketers, take efforts, take time, take cost, which can be, uh, there's there's a huge Delta to, uh, cover. Uh, if you're a marketer today working on traditional mediums, uh, if you were to switch to AI, right? And we're trying to, uh, capture that Delta by building dedicated use cases and possibly, uh, venture into a marketplace, uh, and platform format to to scale these, uh, use cases for all marketers and creators.

Keyvan: [3:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=3m24s) Nice. Yeah. So we're going to do this interview if you agree in two parts. One, we're going to talk specifically about Vinci. So Vinci is your B2B startup, am I correct?

Sid: [3:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=3m39s) That's right, yes, yes.

Keyvan: [3:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=3m39s) So and just to summarize and correct me if I'm wrong, main service that, um, Vinci provides to brands out there is video advertising videos.

Sid: [3:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=3m54s) That's right, yeah. Marketing videos, uh, not just advertising, like there are a bunch of other non-advertising but still marketing videos that we also do.

## Vinci Studio: User Discovery and Onboarding
Keyvan: [4:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=4m5s) Okay, okay, perfect. Uh, can you walk us through the, um, flow of first your user, if when you want to onboard them? Uh, what they what they, uh, how why would you come to your platform? And then what's the process that they, uh, go through to arrive at their destination, at their desired destination?

Sid: [4:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=4m28s) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. So, uh, see, the discovery is actually, uh, rather straightforward. So if you're a marketer today, um, you're already working with, you're most likely already working with, uh, or looking for video agencies who can help you with, uh, your video marketing assets and content. Uh, and there are specific pain points that we've identified that typically these marketers face. For example, video agencies tend to take a while, uh, to turn around the, uh, these video assets. Uh, they typically cost a bomb, um, which let's say a small or medium-sized business cannot afford. Uh, and, uh, then there is just this this, uh, you know, speed of experimentation that is now warranted, right, given given the AI boom and so on. So, uh, as far as the discovery process go, it's the idea is to be able to communicate that all of these issues or pain points that I've pointed out are, uh, circumnavigable. Uh, they can be, uh, you know, they can be, uh, solved for, uh, using using the right AI solution. Uh, so so those are some communication that we're trying to make and we're doing this across various platforms. Uh, of course, I would be honest, um, we've got our initial set of users largely from personal network and people. Uh, so I come from a marketing background. Uh, my previous job was as a product marketer, so I've worked with a lot of agencies, uh, back in India and in the US and some part of Middle East as well. So, uh, there is like some of personal network that I have leveraged at least for the initial, uh, customers. Uh, but now at least most of our inbound is from, uh, either search engines or, uh, inbound content after customers have looked at our social media, right? Uh, so, and social media, when it comes to social media, we're largely doing content around the fact that you can experiment at scale, the fact that you can reduce your, you know, video production costs by almost like 10x. Uh, the fact that you can, uh, you know, put out a campaign in a matter of a single day as opposed to what would typically take let's say two weeks to four weeks.

## Customer Acquisition and SEO Strategy
Keyvan: [6:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=6m48s) That's nice. Um, yeah, so you mentioned that most of your customers currently come from, uh, your personal network, essentially. Um, do you have, do you use any venue to shine? Like try, do you what's what's your main weapon of choice when you want to shield Vinci Studio? Essentially, when you want to, um, do a campaign, do whatever that's on boards new customers?

Sid: [7:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=7m23s) Got it. So I think there are two, two parts to this, right? One is that, uh, our initial set of customers have come from personal network, but we've stopped. We know that it's going to get saturated at some point and we want to, uh, develop a genuine organic way of doing it. So I think that, uh, among the more organic channels that we are looking at right now, I think search engine optimization, including AI, uh, optim AI chatbot optimization is something that we're looking at deeply, right? So we're trying to optimize for, uh, how well can we rank on let's say ChatGPT, uh, prompts or how well can we rank on Google's AI overview and so on. So there there there are some there's some work that's happening there. And right now we're getting about, you know, like roughly 5,000 to 10,000 hits a day, uh, just out of this, uh, search optimization.

Keyvan: [8:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=8m16s) That's really cool. And just it's just people organically through search finding about Vinci.

Sid: [8:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=8m23s) Yeah, yeah. So so essentially, it's somebody, some marketer out there of a small business searching something like, hey, uh, uh, AI, uh, ad creator or AI, uh, education video creator, something along those lines, right? And covering.

## Vinci Studio: Customer Journey and User Interface
Keyvan: [8:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=8m44s) Nice, great job. Um, good job on on finding all those, uh, leads essentially. Um, now, can you walk me through the, um, customer journey? So I've I've found you through, uh, an ad or like just organic search, um, and I want to create a video. What's my UI?

Sid: [9:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=9m10s) Yeah, so so there are two, two again, uh, two broader journeys that we're looking at. One is, if you're a small business, you're typically looking for a subscription and you want to do the leg work yourself versus, uh, you're somewhat of a mid to large size business and you have monies in your pocket and you don't want to do the leg work, right? So if you're a smaller creator, uh, let's say if I was the one who is looking to popularize Vinci using Vinci, right? So I I look up what is the AI video creator that I can use for marketing videos. Uh, I land up on a landing page, I see the subscription plans. Currently, the, uh, subscription plans are, uh, created in a way that for a very small amount of money, I can at least try and see if this work, right? So starting at $5, I can just go ahead and try and see if these video generations are going to make sense for me. Uh, so yeah, I mean, I pick up one of those subscription plans. I land up on a page where I see a lot of, um, uh, right now, six different use cases that are useful to me as a marketer, right? So that includes, um, text to video or prompt to video generation which will give me the main video assets, uh, a couple of clipping tools essentially to clip, uh, let's say a longer video, let's say if I have a podcast or something on those line. Uh, and, uh, let's say if I want want to create a static ad, I we also have, uh, image manipulation, uh, and there is a lip syncing tool if you want to create avatar based videos, right, of of a real human talking about a product. So these are some tools that we have, uh, given to the marketers who are landing on a platform and pick up what they want to do and then there's a workflow that follows, right? So if I pick up lip sync, I get to select which avatar I want to, uh, make speak about my product, select that avatar, type in the text that I want and get the video. Uh, so that's the today, uh, method of doing it. We eventually also want to pivot into like an agentic format where, uh, somebody can just email their asks and then, you know, our our platform gets back to them with here are three options that seem useful to you, and let's take it from there. Why don't you send us your assets and get the video created, right? So we are still building that in-house, um, uh, but yeah, I think that will be a natural transition from, um, what the SAS journey looks like to what an agentic journey looks like.

Keyvan: [11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=11m41s) Nice. So just to see if I have captured it correctly, the UI is like the six different things that are important to me. I choose my destiny is like in Mortal Kombat, you chose your column, right? Then then it's prompt?

Sid: [11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=11m57s) It's promptable as well.

Keyvan: [11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=11m58s) Mhm. Yeah, it it's searchable as well, so right now it's just six workflows. The what we anticipate is going to be hundreds of workflows, right? So, uh, we're still early stage in that effect. So, uh, once we have those hundreds of workflows, there'll obviously be a search aspect to it as well. So think think of this as a marketplace or a platform for all marketing video use cases.

Keyvan: [12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=12m26s) Sorry, my my toddler is at the door banging again. I've got I've got this boss that bosses me around and and and and... Right, so, um, yeah, I totally understand. But then essentially the flow from there on, after you've you've selected your track, is prompt engineering, right? So like I I I submit prompts and then follow on prompts to cook up what I am looking for, right? Is that is that the UI, like a chat box and then or is it different for one of the workflows?

Sid: [13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=13m4s) No, it it's not a chat bot right now. It's actually almost like a, uh, it's it's a SAS, uh, tool.

Keyvan: [13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=13m13s) Is it wizard, next, next?

Sid: [13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=13m13s) Yes, yes, no. There are no next per se. It's a single window. So, for example, if you want to generate video asset, you select the generate video assets, uh, workflow, you go there and that's where you can either input a prompt or you can input a single frame out of which you want to generate a video and then you click generate. The video happen, you can download it.

Keyvan: [13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=13m33s) So you would say the UI is more like Premiere than chat?

Sid: [13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=13m39s) Yeah, yeah. So it's it's more like a video editor than chat.

## Vinci Studio: B2C Aspirations and Trajectory
Keyvan: [13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=13m44s) Okay, got it. That's so cool. Okay, all right. I think I've got the gist of it. Um, next, now bridge, let's bridge to, uh, um, that, um, initial thing that I we we talked about, like stage for shining, essentially, with Vinci Studio. And I know that you had had had had an interest in B2C before. Uh, I want to see how have you have you explored it further?

Sid: [14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=14m12s) Yeah, so I think, uh, as a platform, the idea to do B2B first is because that's where the money is. Uh, we eventually do want to be B2C. Uh, I think the closest trajectory that we see in the web 2 traditional world is Canva. So Canva, if you think about it, did start with a B2B inclination and eventually became like a mass product, right? Uh, I think we're going to be very similar probably, uh, not not as much of a software tool, but more of an agentic tool. That is where maybe like in in future, we will build that chatbot where you can just prompt engineer your way into getting a video. Um, and we are like sort of on the way to do that because we do have like search, for example, implemented today, right? That search will turn into a prompt box later. So, uh, yeah, I think, uh, the B2C inclination, uh, still stands today because just like there are marketers, there are also creators who have very similar use cases. They want to do social media. Um, and if you think about it, any content is marketing. So, uh, so in that case, any content creator is also a marketer and therefore a user, right? So, uh, and, uh, and that will probably make us go B2C. Right now we're just not focused on that because we want to be sharper, uh, in our initial days, right? So we want to crack like one or two use cases very deeply and be like a better product in those use cases, attract user and then keep on giving expanding our scope of workflows, use cases, uh, which is where I was saying, there will there will eventually be like hundreds of use cases today where I are just six.

## Vinci Studio's Value Proposition vs. General AI Models (e.g., Sora)
Keyvan: [16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=16m3s) Nice. Um, I'm going to ask you a question that I I'm sure you've heard a million times. I just want it on the record. What's what's, uh, very special about Vinci Studio? What's the difference between, uh, Vinci and if I just use Sora? What's the value add?

Sid: [16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=16m24s) Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think, uh, the direct value add here is that we are building for marketers, right? Uh, that's not Sora, that's not any of the AI models available there. So the way, uh, we think about this is that for us models or, uh, modality does not matter, uh, and we say this very aggressively in the sense that, uh, it doesn't matter if you're using Sora or V2 or VAN 2.1 or any of these video models under the hood. Uh, what matters is that the user gets what he or she or they want, right? Uh, similar.

Keyvan: [16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=16m58s) And can you talk into specific of what what does your, um, platform do for me as the customer that I cannot find elsewhere? What's the, uh, actual work that's been done that's like a chunk of thing that that's going to solve my problems?

Sid: [17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=17m17s) Right. So I think it it comes, we are building it out of the user intent. What is the user intent? Let's take an example for a marketer, typically the intent is to sell your product. To sell a product, you need to feature the product in the video. Feature the product in the video, you need to show it very accurately integrated very accurately. Uh, using a general foundational model, you cannot do that. But with our, uh, stack essentially on top of those foundational models, you can, right? So what we're selling is a fine-tuned version of said models that helps solve that problem of integrating a product really well from a marketing standpoint, right? So, uh, so if you wanted to create an ad film, um, let's take we, so we worked with Folkswagen, right? And we integrated one of their cars into our ad film video. Uh, you go to Sora, you type however good a prompt you you can find, you cannot recreate that ad because there are like very specific workflows that we've used to get the accuracy of that car as it looks in. And and there is some amount of like, uh, a creative angle also there, right? That is that, uh, let's say somebody who's producing the video can can define what the scenes are going to look like and, uh, put them together, right? Uh, and that's not solely based on prompts going into an AI vision model. Uh, there are like, for example, we use LLMs also, uh, stacked together with, uh, vision model, right?

Keyvan: [19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=19m1s) Do you also have an assets library? Like like do you have, uh, things that users specifically use from your library?

Sid: [19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=19m10s) Yeah, so not in not in the product integration use case, but in the, uh, lip sync use case or the avatar use case, we are, for example, stacking together the best performing avatars on social media. What that means is, uh, you already have like a top 100, uh, uh, faces or expressions that are likely to help you sell your video better than a lot of other things that you will try. So you're ahead already. And then you put in your script, which is again fine-tuned by, uh, certain prominent engineering that we've done done and like sort of automated that process of getting a better script, right? So when you put both of those together, right, the best performing asset speaking about your product with a good script, you get a great ad, right? So, uh, I think that's that's one of the things that we are able to do which again, a vision model solely cannot do. Uh, there is some amount of additional effort it takes using a vision model to do that.

Keyvan: [20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=20m10s) Yeah, exactly. So I think the short answer to that whole Sora what's what you you have like on top of Sora is, yeah, obviously you can do it with Sora or a general model, but then it's going to take you four months to arrive at where where you are if you just use Vinci.

Sid: [20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=20m29s) Yeah, yeah. So the idea is there are either either we've created tried and tested systems or, uh, we have stacked together, uh, tried and tested templates, right? Either of those two things. And that's what's going to get you ahead of, uh, what other people cannot. Or or even if they start today, they'll, like you're saying, will take some time to get there.

## Proposal: Vinci Studio as a Vendor on vhybZ Platform
Keyvan: [20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=20m54s) Got it. All right, so the for the final section of the interview, we want to bridge into solution essentially, uh, a proposal of of mine to you. And you can you don't need to spare my feelings, you can say this is [__] and this is useless, and you know that already. Uh, so I'm hoping to onboard you as a vendor in vhybZ. So and I'm thinking of like like having you as like a pilot of a category, right? So I want to have people with GenAI capabilities like yourself, right? Exactly, people that have that positioning. If you use my tool instead of like the generic, uh, large model, you're ahead because I have some, uh, some processes, some assets that's going to get you ahead, right? Um, and then then my my, uh, proposal to you would be that I would act as your B2C gateway. So instead of you needing to try to find users that are just normal phone users and can be anyone, um, and and it it can be a venue for you to show off. Like you can tell your investors, hey, here's a hockey stick that I have of number of daily active users on vhybZ on the B2C. Or even tell to your customers, see how many people are using my tool on the B2C platform. Um, got it. So give me the rundown. Like don't don't, what what do you think?

Sid: [22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=22m32s) Yeah, so I would want to think about this on a more, uh, so as an idea, obviously, like we we are wanting to list ourselves on multiple distribution platform, right? So so the, um, the blocker, the first blocker that comes to my mind from a business standpoint is, uh, why would we want to distribute on on this platform, right? Is there some other network effect also happening on this platform that will lead me to, uh, the conve- the ments to be distributing there? That network effect could be that maybe the other launches that you're doing, let's say we are defining the video category on your platform, there may be other folks who are doing content, there are, uh, other folks who are doing, um, business networking, any any of those other use case, right? Or industries. So that that helps us find those other users which have which also have a video use case easily, right? So, uh, is that happening or not is the first question I would ask, right? Is there merits to do distribution? Second is on a technical level, right? Uh, I would want to understand is this a deep platform integration versus if it's, uh, today not a deep integration but later will be, or if it's merely a listing, right? Those are the three possibilities. So, uh, we have been doing listings across like various other platforms. So what does it make what what makes this different? So those are some questions that come to mind.

Keyvan: [24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=24m3s) Let me let me first start with that last one. So yes, um, there's those ones that you, as you said, are listing, are marketplaces. Essentially, you're like just saying we exist and then they have some user, they have some network effect. Here is different. It's a platform in the sense that it's a place of conducting, um, t- the task itself. It's not just like a a shop, right? And what we have technically is the flow of Vibe coding simplified for the consumers. So the consumer won't see any code, they will just see iterations. So this is like the app is where you iterate on GenAI concepts and as as a result of each prompt, you get an asset that then next prompt improves on. It's not like a textual and question answer flow. Uh, so it will need an integration which either we do or we give you tools to self-serve do.

## Considerations for Platform Integration and Adoption
Sid: [25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=25m0s) Got it, got it, understood. And, uh, therefore, what does it take to create something like this? Isn't that like a very long term...? Um, so I get the vision, but from an implementation standpoint, right? Like, for example, if I were to focus efforts on this, I there is a trade-off, right? Like I'm missing out on everything else that's working outside. So, uh, and because especially because it's very foundational, it's almost like building a protocol, right? Uh, so why this protocol is something I'm not able to understand, right? Like like as a user, why would I or as a developer in your is, uh, why would I want to develop with this protocol when there is an existing, let's say, protocol or the entire internet out there which does very something very similar?

Keyvan: [28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=28m6s) Yeah, and you're absolutely right. For for me to bait you into coming to this platform instead of every other option, then I need to have that network effect for you. You I need to deliver to you with with this set of assumptions that we're going, right? I need to my delivery to you is that hockey stick of user growth. Right? And so so would you validate my assumption if I am at the place that I can give you that hockey stick, is that enough? I'd be happy to come, right?

Sid: [28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=28m30s) Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so so then it's like I'm building for Android, I'm building for iOS, why not also build for this protocol, uh, which is like interactive media apps? Like like if I... Yeah, it is it is is that...?

Keyvan: [28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=28m45s) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Sid: [28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=28m47s) So so so yeah, I mean I would just think of it on those lines, right? It's a it's a tech call to take based on what is the fastest growing platform.

Keyvan: [28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=28m54s) Yeah, so it's it it's it's it's on me to deliver that before you are an angel user of mine. Uh, yeah.

Sid: [29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=29m2s) And probably not even uh before we like, we would want to join after there are users. We can join before there are users, as long as there is uh enough validation that there are going to be users, right? That this makes sense and this can, uh, be at least among the top five future platforms or protocols, right? Where apps will exist. Nice. Uh, and that can be in one or two ways, right? One is that fundamentally it's going to be there for for any reason, right? Typically platforms flourish on the basis of hardware, so you distribute good hardware that has that platform, people are on that platform, right? That's how Windows or, uh, even like Android, etc. have done it. There are other ways that you have a very like far superior, uh, tertiary product which is like Chrome, right? So Chrome doesn't ship on any device, uh, at least on the web, but still is the top browser because, uh, people are able to do it. So, uh, I think that's, uh, like the trajectory. If there is any, somehow we're able to show that hey, this is where we are going, uh, and why we are going to be able to be there, if if that is clear, then then probably it's a good reason to onboard.

Keyvan: [30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=30m24s) So essentially, the trajectory to be top five, right? Or, um, yeah, and and that what is the top five, uh, you can define yourself, right? It doesn't have to be like Android, iOS, and interactive media. It can be anything. Got it. Um, I've lost your video. Are you okay?

Sid: [30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=30m46s) Yeah, no no, I think I just got a call.

## Designing an Ideal B2C Platform for Vinci on vhybZ
Keyvan: [30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=30m51s) All right, sorry. We we will be concluding in like two, three, four minutes. Um, so as a last question for you, Sid, now that you have all the contexts, sit on the designer chair and design for yourself the ideal B2C platform that you would onboard, uh, Vinci to, that gives you a B2C edge. And tell me what it is without try to remove your bias from everything you know from the conversation and tell me your ideal word. You're the designer now, you're my boss. Tell me what to build.

Sid: [31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=31m26s) Uh, yeah, I think it needs to be some kind of, uh, okay, from a modality perspective, it's going to be voice and chat, so very similar to ChatGPT or, uh, your newer age model, Perplexity and Gemini, etc. Uh, so the modality seems to be can I put in my query in free form text? Right? That is for sure the is. And then as a developer, can I build some kind of, uh, drag and drop solution to implement it, uh, which is, um, for videos for example, uh, as a developer, I'm able to marry certain types of prompts to to to my use cases, right? And then probably you can have your internal algorithm to figure out what is the best workflow to pick whenever somebody types in a particular query, right? Uh, so yeah, I think that's that's the direction that I would take. So essentially a chat window, option to voice it in or type it in, uh, and whenever I do that, it links to the correct workflow in the background, right? It should be as simple as that. Uh, so that would be my let's say a Vinci interactive app, uh, right? And and then of course, the ability to then access and then some amount, like those are features, but basically the ability to sort of link back or call back on any older creations, assets, any media that we've created before, just sort of tagged them and so on. Or ideally a memory mechanism where the tooling can understand and remember that this person had created their avatar, right? So for example, if I train my avatar on the chat window and next time I say, "Hey, make Siddhan talk this," it should automatically pick the avatar that I'll ask and make them say that or at least do a prompt around it. So so I think something on those.

## "Prompt Your Tool" Concept and Open Ecosystem
Keyvan: [33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=33m26s) Yeah, yeah. No, what you just said, I've been thinking about this. This is like completely uncut, not not even designed yet. It's just like a an idea stage, which is prompt your tool, right? So when you're in ChatGPT, you have deep pre-search, you have like the you you get the drop down of tools. What if you can prompt and say what kind of button you want, right? Yeah. And then then give this both to consumer, to the end user, and to the developer or vendor, as I call them.

Sid: [33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=33m53s) Correct, correct.

Keyvan: [33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=33m55s) Do do tell me what you want. I will generate. Yeah, this is this is very similar to what MCPS, uh, look like today. Uh, but I I think probably, uh, so MCPS are for developers, something like that for users, yes, that you can easily like. So so think about it, like how Google is able to add a G and then we can access a Google Drive and everything. Similarly, if you were able to access any tool on your platform true, just by giving access, so like log into vhybZ and then pick the tools that you want.

Keyvan: [34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=34m29s) Or even tool that doesn't exist, like on the on the fly.

Sid: [34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=34m35s) Yeah, yeah. So yeah, I think, yeah, that would be a very nice experience to have on because right now most of these ecosystems are closed in the sense that like ChatGPT only offers whatever would be Yeah on ChatGPT or maybe at best Google, right? So all of these AI models are closed and that's sort of harping on their own ability to perform with like other external tools.

## Value of Open Source
Keyvan: [35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=35m3s) So yeah, yeah. Now now that you just brought it up, this is the drill down phase. Um, would like we are open source and we're going to be like everything we do is open source. Everything we onboard, uh, like on our end is like pure open source DNA on its own. Is that a positive for you that these guys are this app that's not corporate, it's not ChatGPT, it's not Cloud, it's not Gemini. Would it would it have any value in in your perception or is it just, no, I don't care?

Sid: [35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=35m36s) Uh, so I think, uh, as a business owner, it may be a positive only if there is also going to be additive effects of it. So for you, the additive effect is that there will be more developers potentially. For me, the additive effect is if I put I also open source let's say an MCP equivalent onto your protocol, will there be other developers helping me build it or make it more efficient? So if if that happens, then it's a plus. If that doesn't happen or if there are not the means to do that, then it's just another open source, yeah. So obviously a fork of VS.

Keyvan: [36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=36m16s) Definitely, yeah.

Sid: [36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=36m16s) But definitely there's no downside to it, the way I put.

Keyvan: [36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=36m19s) So there's no negative either, it's neutral or better, right? Yeah, true.

## Concluding Thoughts and Need for Prototype
Keyvan: [36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=36m19s) All right, that's it. Everything I had on my end. And to conclude, do you have anything that you want to be on the record added from that you think would be beneficial to the research, or do you have questions for me? Feel free form.

Sid: [36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=36m42s) Yeah, I think, uh, as a again, this is just like as a business owner, if I were to be doing something like this, I would want to, uh, hack together an MVP or some kind of prototype which with which I can visualize. So some of the things that we discussed, right? That that are drop down that helps you connect with any any tool out there or a chat window which links back to, uh, whatever we are speaking about or like the previous media file or something on those, I think if if there's a prototype, it'll be just like faster to visualize, um, and build for. So for example, uh, we've been thinking for Vinci, we've been thinking that we want to build a similar chatbot, but if there's already an existing solution, we would just want to integrate it, right? We wouldn't want to build this because for business that is not additional value, right? For me, for you it is, for me it isn't to build another chatbot. Uh, so I just want to basically integrate my workflows into an existing service. So, uh, so I think yeah, prototyping and helping. Because again, from an implementation point of view, I'm still not able to visualize this, and I think I'll only be able to visualize when there's an actual product to do it with. So yeah, true.

Keyvan: [38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=38m3s) So go build, Keyvan.

Sid: [38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=38m4s) Yes, sir.

Keyvan: [38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=38m5s) I will do that. Okay, all cool. Thank you so much for your time, Sid, and we will obviously keep in contact and and we will we'll talk off camera as well. Thank you so much.

Sid: [38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nXjoT3sPE&t=38m14s) Yeah, done. Thank you.
